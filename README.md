# Driving School Management Application

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a modern, full-stack-ready web application designed to streamline the management of pupil records for a driving school. Built with a focus on a robust user experience and maintainable architecture, it provides a comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for pupil data.

The application features an interactive table with advanced functionalities like global search, sorting, pagination, row selection, and bulk actions. Each pupil record can be viewed, edited, or deleted through dedicated pages, ensuring a complete and intuitive management workflow.

## ✨ Key Features

    *   **Delete Pupil:** Individual and bulk deletion capabilities.
*   **Interactive Pupil Table:**
    *   **Global Search:** Filter pupils across all relevant fields.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps:

### 1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd driving-school-app
```

### 2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example`.
You'll need to specify your backend API base URL:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api # Replace with your actual backend URL
```

### 4. **Run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the application, usually accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 💡 Design Decisions & Architecture Highlights

*   **Separation of Concerns:** The project strictly separates UI components, API logic, state management, and routing into distinct modules. This enhances readability, testability, and maintainability.
*   **Type Safety with TypeScript & Zod:**
    *   **`TypeScript`** is used throughout the codebase to catch errors early and improve code quality.
    *   **`Zod`** schemas define the shape and validation rules for pupil data, automatically inferring TypeScript types (`Pupil`, `PupilInput`). This ensures that data conforms to expectations both at runtime and compile time.
*   **Efficient Data Handling with `React Query`:**
    *   `React Query` is leveraged for all server-side data interactions (fetching, mutations). It provides automatic caching, background re-fetching, and robust error/loading state management, significantly improving performance and developer experience.
    *   Mutations (add, edit, delete) automatically invalidate relevant queries, ensuring the UI reflects the latest data without manual refetching.
*   **Global State Management with `Zustand`:**
    *   `Zustand` is used for managing client-side UI state that needs to be shared across components, such as the `PupilsTable`'s global filter, row selection, and pagination state. Its lightweight nature and simple API make it ideal for this purpose.
*   **Declarative UI with `React Table`:**
    *   `TanStack React Table` is used to build the interactive pupil list. Its headless nature allows for complete control over the UI while providing powerful features like sorting, filtering, and pagination through a declarative API. Column definitions are separated into `columns.tsx` for clarity.
*   **Reusable Forms with `React Hook Form`:**
    *   The `PupilForm` component is designed for reusability across both "Add Pupil" and "Edit Pupil" functionalities. `React Hook Form` provides an efficient way to manage form state, validation, and submission, minimizing re-renders.
*   **Intuitive Routing with `TanStack Router`:**
    *   File-based routing simplifies route definition and organization. Dynamic routes (`$pupilId`) are used for viewing and editing specific pupil records, adhering to RESTful principles.
*   **Modern Styling with `Tailwind CSS` & `ShadCN UI`:**
    *   `Tailwind CSS` enables rapid UI development with a utility-first approach.
    *   `ShadCN UI` provides a set of accessible and customizable components built on `Radix UI`, ensuring a consistent and polished look and feel.
